# Classrooms - ECS657U Multi-platform Games Development
Welcome to the Unity project repository! This project is being developed using **Unity 2023.1.20f1**. Below you will find important details about the workflow, version control, and overall objectives of the project.

## Getting Started
Before diving into the project, ensure that you have the following set up:

Unity Version: We are using Unity 2023.1.20f1. Please ensure you have this version installed.

Scene Management: Work on your own scene, and avoid altering scenes belonging to other team members. Your scenes have already been created for you.

Version Control: We are using Git for version control. Make sure to only push changes to your own repository/branch. Your repositories have already been created for you.

## Version Control Guidelines
1. Branching:
Create your own branch for any new feature or bug fix you’re working on. Use meaningful names for branches like feature/your-name-new-feature.
Do not push directly to the main branch unless you are sure your changes are ready and have been tested.

2. Pull Requests:
Submit a pull request (PR) when you're ready for your changes to be reviewed.
Include a clear description of what you’ve done, any issues fixed, and instructions for testing.

3. Commit Messages: Use descriptive commit messages to summarize the changes.

## Using GitHub Projects
We will be using GitHub projects as our project management tool, use it to see any assigned tasks, create new tasks or raise any issues. Move a completed task to the completed column once done.

You can access GitHub projects for this repository on the bar at the top.

## Playing the game (as of final game)
Players can walk using WASD, crouch using C and interact with certain objects using E and left-click (a pop-up box will appear if it is interactable). The player can look around using their mouse.
Pick-up objects can also be picked up by pressing E, and then used using left-click.
Doors will open automatically by walking near them (no button input is required), of course they may not open immediately if the room has a puzzle or requirement before leaving the room!
Avoid enemies by not looking at them.
Select your difficulty at the main menu.
